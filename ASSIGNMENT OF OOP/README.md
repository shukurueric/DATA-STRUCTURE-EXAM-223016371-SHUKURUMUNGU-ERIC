# Assignment description of codes 
## 1.	#include <iostream>:
### Including the iostream Library

At the very beginning of our C++ program, we have #include <iostream>.  This line is crucial because it includes the iostream library iostream specifically provides the tools for input and output operations
## 2.	using namespace std;:
### Using the Standard Namespace

using namespace std;.  This line tells the compiler to use the std (standard) namespace.  Namespaces are like containers for names.  iostream By using this line, we can use the names of these components (like cout and cin) directly without having to write std::cout and std::cin every time
## 3.	int main() 
### The Main Function: Where Execution Begins

Every C++ program must have a main() function.  This is the entry point of your program – it's where the execution begins.  The int before main indicates that the function returns an integer value.  
## 4.	cout <<:
### Displaying Output with cout

Inside the main() function, we often use cout to display output to the console (your screen).  cout is an object from the iostream library. The << operator is used to "insert" data into the output stream.
endl is another useful tool from iostream. 

## 5.	cin >> ...; (Input):
### Getting Input with cin

cin is used to get input from the user.  It's also an object from the iostream library. The >> operator is used to extract data from the input stream.

## 6.	return 0;:
### Returning from Main

At the end of the main() function
